# Ironclaw — Implementation Plan

> **Audience.** This plan is written so that multiple agent teams can work
> in parallel on independent crates without stepping on each other. Each
> "Team" section is self-contained: it has scope, deliverables, the crate
> APIs it owns, the contracts other teams depend on it for, and acceptance
> criteria.

## Project tenets — "OpenBSD of claw agents"

Ironclaw's defining posture is the OpenBSD playbook applied to agent
runtimes. Every operational decision in M13 onwards is judged against
these invariants. They are not aspirations; a PR that violates one is
not landing.

1. **No stubs in tree.** A half-implemented adapter is worse than no
   adapter — it lies to the registry and fails at message time. If a
   crate can't be finished, it gets deleted (whatsapp native crate,
   M12). The "no stubs" rule is what made the workspace ~7600 LOC
   smaller and made the chat loop possible to debug.
2. **Secure-by-default, public-by-deliberate-act.** Every webhook
   binds `127.0.0.1` unless the operator explicitly chooses
   otherwise. The cli channel pre-approves only the literal local
   sender. The `.env` is `0o600`. The host writes tracing to
   stderr so log capture never contaminates the data path. Add
   capabilities, never default to them.
3. **One process, single binary.** `ironclaw` is the host;
   `ironclaw-runner` runs inside containers; `iclaw` is the admin
   client. No daemons-spawning-daemons. No optional foreground /
   background mode flags. Setup writes one `.env` and one
   service-unit and that's the deploy surface.
4. **Documentation is a deliverable.** Every crate's `lib.rs`
   doc-string explains what the crate does, what its inputs are,
   and what the error paths mean. Every command in `iclaw` has
   `--help` text written for an operator, not a developer. The
   bar is OpenSSH's man pages, not "auto-generated from docstrings".
5. **Conservative defaults.** Idle-stop timeout: minutes, not
   hours. Retry cap: 3, not infinity. Token / cost budget: opt-in
   capped, not unlimited. Rate limit: present even when low.
   Surprises always cost money.
6. **Audit everything that mutates.** Every iclaw socket call
   that writes — `groups.create`, `wirings.create`, etc. — lands
   in an `audit_log` table with caller, command, args, and
   result. Read paths excluded. The host can be forensically
   reconstructed from the log + the central DB snapshot.
7. **Reproducible builds.** Image fingerprints include the
   runner binary bytes. Same source → same sha-tag → same
   deployable artifact. No "latest" tags, no float, no
   yesterday's image silently running today.
8. **Pinned upstreams.** Workspace deps are version-pinned in
   `Cargo.toml`. `Cargo.lock` is checked in. CI runs
   `cargo deny` against an explicit allow-list of licenses + a
   block-list of yanked / unmaintained crates.
9. **Signed releases.** Every release tag is GPG-signed. The
   `release-checklist.md` includes the signing step; CI verifies
   the tag's signature before publishing artifacts.
10. **Errors over silent fallback.** A misconfigured channel
    fails loudly at boot — it does not silently disable itself.
    A bad webhook signature returns 401 — it does not silently
    accept. An unknown sender goes to a pending queue — it is
    not silently routed. Operators learn fast or not at all.

The 0.1.0 release ships when M13 is checked through and the
remaining items in M11 (replay-fixture harness, 0.1.0 tag) are
shipped. Until then the README's "candidate" status is the
honest one.

M1 totals (this slice): 211 new table-module tests + 57 infrastructure tests = **272 passing tests in `ironclaw-db`**.
Workspace totals: **290 passing tests** (272 db + 3 db integration + 15 types). Clippy clean on `--all-targets`.

### M2 — T4 container-rt, T8 skills, T11 onecli (parallel after M1)
- [x] T4 `ContainerRuntime` trait + `DockerRuntime` (bollard) + `AppleContainerRuntime` (CLI shell-out) — 70 tests, 2 ignored (daemon-bound)
- [x] T4 image build (`apt-packages`, `npm-packages` per `container_configs`) — sha256-fingerprinted tags; inline USTAR tar writer for the build context
- [x] T8 skill discovery (frontmatter parse, per-group override) — 59 tests; name mismatch is an error, missing named-skill is a skip
- [x] T8 skill materializer (symlinks into container mount) — idempotent; rejects path-escape; refuses to clobber non-symlink entries
- [x] T11 OneCLI HTTP client (`ensure_agent`, `apply_container_config`, approvals) — 84 tests; full wiremock coverage for 401/404/409/429/5xx + `Retry-After` parsing

### M3 — T5 runner/providers/mcp, T6 channels core+cli, T7 modules (parallel)
- [x] T5 provider trait + Anthropic HTTP streaming + tool-use loop — `AgentProvider`/`AgentQuery`; `AnthropicProvider` over SSE; 49 tests (35 unit + 14 wiremock)
- [x] T5 context compaction (configurable strategy) — window 200k, margin 8k, `chars/4` token estimate, archives pre-compaction transcript to `outbox/_compactions/<ts>.md`
- [x] T5 MCP server with all 15 tools (see § 7) — `ToolContext` trait + `OutboundToolEffect` sum type; 95 tests
- [x] T5 MCP client (stdio for external servers); HTTP-SSE is wired but gated behind rmcp's `transport-sse-client` feature (returns `McpError::Protocol` stub until enabled)
- [x] T5 container poll loop + formatter + destinations — 84 tests; system-kind JSON envelopes documented for host integration; state resume via `session_state`
- [x] T6 `core` crate: trait + registry — 41 tests; reusable `MockAdapter`/`MockFactory` in a public `testing` module
- [x] T6 `cli` crate: stdin/stdout channel — 26 tests; pluggable reader/writer for tests, stdio bound by default
- [x] T7 modules: typing, mount-security, permissions, approvals, interactive, scheduling, agent-to-agent, self-mod — 152 tests (151 unit + 1 integration); `ModuleContext` trait defines the host hook surface ahead of M4

M2+M3 totals (this slice): 460 new tests across 9 crates; full workspace **~950 passing tests**. Clippy clean on `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

### M4 — T3 host (integrates M2+M3)
- [x] Host `main` boot sequence (signals, migrations, runtime check, orphan cleanup) — `ironclaw {run,migrate,version}`; graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM with 30s shutdown deadline
- [x] Router (hook chain, fan-out, session resolution) — 58 tests; session_mode policy: Shared / PerThread / AgentShared all implemented; 500ms debouncer + in-flight re-entry guard
- [x] Delivery (active 1s, sweep 60s, re-entry guard, retries) — 71 tests; exponential backoff `5_000 * 2^(tries-1)` capped at `ABSOLUTE_CEILING_MS`; 3-attempt cap then marks failed
- [x] Sweep (stuck detection, recurrence fanout, processing-ack reset) — 61 tests; injectable `Clock` for deterministic time; series_id correlation; emits `SweepReport` for the host's container manager
- [x] `ironclaw run` boots successfully and idles cleanly — verified via `boot::tests::run_host_boots_with_noop_runtime_and_idles`; live runtime not exercised in this slice (no daemon available)

### M5 — T9 iclaw
- [x] Unix-socket server inside host — newline-delimited JSON at `data/iclaw.sock` mode `0o600`; cancellation token shutdown
- [x] `iclaw` binary client — 87 tests; lib + bin; pluggable `CallTransport`
- [x] All resource subcommands (see § A2) — 41 distinct command strings exported as `ironclaw_iclaw::ALL_COMMANDS`; every handler maps to `ironclaw-db` table fns
- [x] CLI-scope enforcement for agent callers — `HOST_ONLY_COMMANDS` set; agents calling mutation cmds get `permission_denied`

M4+M5 totals (this slice): 446 new tests across 5 crates (router 58 + delivery 71 + sweep 61 + iclaw 87 + host 169). Full workspace **1396 passing tests, 3 ignored, 0 failures**. Clippy clean on `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

M6+M7+M9+M10 totals (this slice): 575 new tests across 6 deliverables (setup 175 + telegram 120 + slack 101 + discord 134 + providers +45 = 94 total + 17 skills authored). Full workspace **1971 passing tests, 3 ignored, 0 failures**. Clippy clean.

### M6 — T10 setup
- [x] Interactive setup (`dialoguer`) — 13 step modules; `Prompt` trait with `Interactive` / `EnvBacked` / `Scripted` impls
- [x] systemd unit / launchd plist generators — `units.rs` snapshot-tested
- [x] Headless mode (env-var driven) — `IRONCLAW_SETUP_*` env-var surface
- [x] Optional data-directory migrator — `--migrate-from <path>` copies `ironclaw.db` and re-runs migrations
- 175 tests in `ironclaw-setup`. Stubs: image-build step requires live runtime (skipped without); CLI-agent step only checks PATH.

### M7 — First three real channels (T6 parallel)
- [x] T6 telegram (long-poll + webhook) — 162 tests; both ingress modes; multipart `sendDocument`; inbound `document` / `photo` (largest variant) / `audio` / `video` / `voice` / `video_note` / `sticker` downloaded via `getFile` + the file endpoint and written under `data_dir/inbox/<msg_id>/<filename>` (path + metadata in `content.attachment`); `attachment_download` (default `true`) toggles back to the metadata-only `MessageKind::System` fallback; `max_attachment_bytes` (default 20 MB — Bot API hard cap) demotes oversized files / `getFile` failures to `System` with `reason` + captured error
- [x] T6 slack (events API + Web API) — 101 tests; HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (hand-rolled); files v2 upload flow; 256-entry event_id LRU
- [x] T6 discord (slim gateway + REST) — 134 tests; tokio-tungstenite gateway client; pure codec/lifecycle parsers fully unit-tested; intent constant noted as `38_401` (PLAN's `33_281` was arithmetically off)

### M8 — Remaining channels (T6 parallel batch)

Batch 1 (REST/webhook):
- [x] resend (Resend.com email; send-only) — 114 tests, 2082 LOC; REST `POST /emails`, base64 attachments, no ingress (Resend has no user-reply surface)
- [x] github (issue/PR/review comments + webhook) — 167 tests, 3366 LOC; HMAC-SHA256 webhook with `X-GitHub-Delivery` LRU dedup, `platform_id = "{owner}/{repo}#{number}"`, 8-slug emoji map, `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0` → `Rate`
- [x] linear (GraphQL + webhook) — 153 tests, 3403 LOC; HMAC-SHA256 webhook, `commentCreate`/`commentUpdate`/`reactionCreate` mutations, GraphQL `errors[]` lifted to `Auth`/`Rate`/`BadRequest`
- [x] webex (REST + webhook) — 181 tests, 4291 LOC; HMAC-SHA1 (or SHA256) webhook, body fetch via `GET /messages/{id}` because Webex omits text from webhooks, `person:` platform_id prefix routes DMs via `toPersonId`, beta `POST /reactions` 404/501 → `Unsupported`

Batch 2 (REST/webhook + long-poll):
- [x] matrix (Client-Server REST + `/sync` long-poll) — 146 tests + 1 ignored, 3719 LOC; persists `next_batch` to `data_dir/next_batch.txt`; `m.text`/`m.file`/`m.image`/`m.audio`/`m.video` events; alias resolution cached; threads via `m.relates_to`; one test ignored (`sync_loop_pushes_events_and_persists_next_batch`) — mock would saturate the 8-cap mpsc; fix is to use `up_to_n_times` on the mock or `select!` around the inbound send
- [x] teams (MS Graph REST + change-notifications webhook) — 156 tests, 3791 LOC; validation handshake (`?validationToken=…` → `text/plain` 200); `clientState` constant-time-compare; `team/{T}/channel/{C}` and `chat/{C}` platform_id shapes; 6-reaction map (`like`/`heart`/`laugh`/`surprised`/`sad`/`angry`); HTML→text fallback
- [x] gchat (Google Chat REST + HTTP push) — 134 tests, 3127 LOC; v1 simplification: `?token=<client_token>` instead of JWT verification (documented); `MESSAGE`+`CARD_CLICKED` events; emoji shortcode → numeric Unicode codepoint table (no literal emoji in source); `cardsV2` for cards
- [x] whatsapp-cloud (Meta Cloud API) — 142 tests, 3475 LOC; `hub.verify_token` handshake + `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC; `<phone_number_id>:<wa_id>` platform_id; `text`/`image`/`document`/`audio`/`video`/`button`/`interactive` events; `set_typing` = `mark_read` of last message; edit → `Unsupported`; reactions via `type:"reaction"`

Batch 3 (subprocess RPC + REST/poll):
- [x] signal (signal-cli daemon, stdio JSON-RPC) — 144 tests, 3466 LOC; `RpcTransport` trait abstracts the subprocess (no test spawns `signal-cli`); `user:<e164>` + `group:<base64>` platform_id; JSON-RPC error codes -1 → Auth, -3 → Rate; safe-attachment-name validation; system actions: edit / reaction / delete supported
- [x] deltachat (`deltachat-rpc-server` stdio JSON-RPC) — 165 tests; `RpcTransport` + `MockTransport` (no test spawns the server); `account/<id>/chat/<id>` platform_id; chat-type → `is_group` mapping; `edit` → `Unsupported`; outbound attachments written to `data_dir/outgoing/`; inbound attachments go through `download_full_msg` when `download_state != "Done"`, then the blob is `stat` + `open`-verified and the resolved on-disk path surfaced under `content.attachment.bytes_path` (with `size` / `mime`); `attachment_download` (default `true`), `blob_dir` (optional override for shared-blob deployments), and `max_attachment_bytes` (default 50 MiB) gate the behaviour, with oversized files / `download_full_msg` / `stat` / `open` failures demoted to `MessageKind::System` with `reason` + captured error; `add_account` called eagerly when configured `account_id = 0` and no accounts exist
- [x] emacs (emacsclient subprocess) — 117 tests, 2336 LOC; `EmacsClient` trait abstracts the spawn (real `EmacsClientCli` only invoked when intentionally testing a missing-binary case); `${BUFFER_JSON}` / `${TEXT_JSON}` template substitution; defaults `(ironclaw-pop-inbound)` + `(ironclaw-deliver ${BUFFER_JSON} ${TEXT_JSON})`; files + `edit` + `reaction` → `Unsupported`; stderr matching `can't find socket` → `Auth`
- [x] x (Twitter/X v2 DMs + v1.1 media upload + `/2/dm_events` polling) — 141 tests, 3224 LOC; `user:<id>` + `conversation:<id>` platform_id; since-id persisted to `data_dir/x_dm_since_id.txt`; 429 priority order `x-rate-limit-reset` → `Retry-After` → 60s fallback; media_category inferred from filename extension; `set_typing` no-op; `edit`/`reaction` → `Unsupported`

- [x] All 15 registered in host `build_registry` — single test asserts every in-tree factory is present (cli + 3 M7 + 4 batch 1 + 4 batch 2 + 4 batch 3 + wechat + imessage + whatsapp = 19)

- [x] whatsapp (native Baileys port — websocket + e2e crypto, skeleton) — 308 tests, 6389 LOC; ships the full transport + framing + protocol-state-machine stack above a pluggable `CryptoBackend` trait, but real e2e crypto is **deferred** behind `StubBackend` (every primitive returns `CryptoError::NotImplemented`) so `deliver` / `set_typing` / edit / reaction return `AdapterError::Unsupported` until a `libsignal-protocol`-backed `CryptoBackend` is dropped in; `[flags][u24 length][payload]` frame codec; WhatsApp binary-XML codec with a small token table (`iq` ping/pong round-trips); Noise XX handshake state machine (`Initial -> SentE -> ReceivedSE -> Done`/`Failed`); atomic-write JSON keystore with corruption rotation; `WsTransport` trait + `tokio-tungstenite` real impl + `MockTransport`; `user:<wa_id>` + `group:<jid>` platform_id; full lifecycle (connect / heartbeat / cancellation / reconnect-backoff) tested against the mock
  - whatsapp `CryptoBackend` now has a real `DalekBackend` default (X25519 / HKDF-SHA256 / AES-256-GCM / Ed25519 via `x25519-dalek` + `hkdf` + `aes-gcm` + `ed25519-dalek`); 80 new tests exercising RFC 7748 § 5.2 X25519, RFC 5869 A.1/A.2/A.3 HKDF, and RFC 8032 § 7.1 Ed25519 vectors; outbound `deliver` is still gated on the Signal Protocol session-state machinery (X3DH + Double Ratchet + sender keys + envelope construction), which sits above the primitives and remains unwritten — the adapter surfaces a distinct "pipeline not yet implemented above the CryptoBackend" message in that branch
- [x] imessage (local macOS Messages.app — osascript + sqlite chat.db) — 193 tests, 3565 LOC; `IMessageBridge` trait abstracts both `osascript` and `sqlite3` (no test invokes either binary); Cocoa-epoch nanos auto-detected vs. seconds and converted to `DateTime<Utc>`; hand-rolled `applescript_escape` rejects null + C0 controls (except `\n`/`\r`/`\t`) and escapes `"` / `\`; `handle:<email-or-phone>` + `chat:<chat-guid>` platform_id shapes; high-water `ROWID` persisted to `data_dir/imessage_since_rowid.txt`; `edit` / `reaction` system actions → `Unsupported` (AppleScript tapback surface unreliable); `set_typing` no-op; chat.db unreachable (Full Disk Access) → `Auth`
- [x] wechat (WeChat Work / Work Weixin — REST + webhook) — 196 tests, 4390 LOC; hand-rolled `WXBizMsgCrypt` (AES-256-CBC + PKCS7) + SHA1-over-sorted-concat signature (not HMAC); `user:` / `party:` / `tag:` platform_id prefixes for `touser` / `toparty` / `totag`; cached `gettoken` via `TokenStore` with one-shot retry on `errcode 42001`; `text` / `image` / `voice` / `video` / `file` / `event` inbound types; `edit` and `reaction` system actions → `Unsupported`; corp_id checked inside decrypted payload; consumer WeChat deliberately out of scope (no documented API)

M8 totals (3 slices + tail): 2433 new tests across 15 channels (batch 1: 114 + 167 + 153 + 181 = 615; batch 2: 146 + 156 + 134 + 142 = 578; batch 3: 144 + 141 + 117 + 141 = 543; tail: wechat 196 + imessage 193 + whatsapp 308 = 697). Workspace **4406 passing tests, 4 ignored, 0 failures**. Clippy clean on `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

### M9 — Provider variants (T5 parallel)
- [x] codex provider (subprocess + JSON protocol) — thin wrapper over shared `SubprocessProvider`
- [x] opencode provider (same shape, different binary) — `PushPolicy::Accept` by default
- [x] ollama provider (Anthropic-compatible base URL) — built on `AnthropicProvider::with_base_url`, default model `llama3.1:8b`; no changes to `anthropic.rs`
- 94 tests in `ironclaw-providers` (was 49). JSON-Lines bridge protocol documented for subprocess providers.

### M10 — Skill content
- [x] Author ironclaw-native skill content for each capability under `skills/` — 17 skills authored (send-message, send-file, edit-message, add-reaction, send-card, ask-user-question, schedule-task, install-packages, add-mcp-server, create-agent, messaging-context, destinations, approvals, typing-indicator, cli-channel, discovering-tools, error-handling)
- [x] Document the "adding a channel" workflow — `docs/adding-a-channel.md` (500 lines): traits, crate layout, inbound/outbound mapping, error mapping, testing strategy, host wiring, PR checklist

### M11 — Differential testing + release
- [x] Cutover docs — `docs/cutover.md` (preflight → quiesce → snapshot → migrate → verify → switch ingress → first-hour watch → rollback)
- [x] Replay-fixture suite design — `docs/replay-fixtures.md` (fixture layout, harness internals, capture/redact workflow)
- [x] Release-checklist + CI — `docs/release-checklist.md`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs fmt + clippy + test on Linux/macOS with an 85% coverage gate; `CHANGELOG.md` seeded with the Keep-a-Changelog `[Unreleased]` section
- [ ] Replay-fixture harness implementation + first captured fixture (the M11 acceptance gate — design is in-tree, in-process harness against `Fixture::load` / `ReplayHarness::{boot_host, run, compare}` still to be written)
- [ ] Release 0.1.0 (cut the tag, bump `workspace.package.version`, publish release notes from CHANGELOG)

### M11 — Post-M10 hardening (this slice)

These items closed open stubs and added coverage the earlier milestones had explicitly deferred. Each ships as part of the 0.1.0 candidate.

- [x] **Matrix `/sync` cancellation fix** — wrapped the inbound `mpsc::send` in `select!` against the shutdown token so the loop exits cleanly even when the channel is saturated. Re-enabled `sync_loop_pushes_events_and_persists_next_batch`; matrix now ships 147 passing tests with no `#[ignore]` markers.
- [x] **MCP HTTP-SSE transport** — enabled rmcp's `transport-sse-client` + `reqwest` features and replaced the `connect_http_sse` placeholder. Static headers (auth bearer, etc.) thread through via a pre-loaded `reqwest::Client`. 15 client tests including malformed-header rejection, invalid-URL classification, and a wiremock check that wrong `content-type` lands as `Transport`.
- [x] **`groups.restart` wired** — replaced the `{"queued": true}` stub with a `sessions::list_for_agent_group` (new) + `mark_container_stopped` loop. Returns `{agent_group_id, sessions_marked_stopped, sessions}`; sessions already in `stopped` state are counted as no-change. 5 new handler tests + 2 new DB tests cover the happy path, the no-sessions case, the unknown-group not-found, and cross-group isolation.
- [x] **WhatsApp `DalekBackend`** — replaced `StubBackend` as the default `CryptoBackend` with a real Curve25519 + Ed25519 + HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM impl on `x25519-dalek` + `ed25519-dalek` + `hkdf` + `aes-gcm`. 80 new tests including RFC 7748 § 5.2, RFC 5869 A.1/A.2/A.3, and RFC 8032 § 7.1 vectors. Outbound `deliver` is still gated on the Signal Protocol session state above the primitives; the adapter surfaces a distinct error string for that branch so the gap is testable.
- [x] **Telegram + Deltachat attachment downloads** — flipped both channels from `MessageKind::System` placeholders to real downloads. Telegram adds `get_file` + binary stream + `attachment_download` (default true) / `max_attachment_bytes` (default 20 MB) config knobs (+42 tests → 162). Deltachat calls `download_full_msg` when `download_state != "Done"`, then `stat` + `open`-verifies the blob (with optional `blob_dir` override) and surfaces the resolved path under `content.attachment.bytes_path` (+24 tests → 165). Oversized / auth-failure / network-failure paths demote to `System` with a captured reason.

**Hardening totals (this slice):** ~165 new tests across 6 deliverables. Workspace **4564 passing tests, 4 ignored, 0 failures**. Clippy clean on `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

### M12 — Local-chat slice (this slice; closes the round-trip)

The end-to-end chat path was never wired in M0–M11: every layer
shipped tested in isolation but nothing connected `inbound.db` to a
running container that called the provider. M12 closes that gap and
the cosmetic follow-ups it surfaced.

- [x] **Native whatsapp crate removed.** The previous `StubBackend`
  → `DalekBackend` migration left an adapter whose `deliver` still
  returned `Unsupported` until the Signal-Protocol session layer
  above the primitives was built. Per the project invariant of
  "no stubs in tree", the whole crate (~7.6k LOC, ~384 tests) was
  removed. `whatsapp-cloud` (Meta Cloud Business API) remains as
  the supported WhatsApp path.
- [x] **OpenRouter / Anthropic-compatible providers.** Added
  `api_base_url` to `RunnerConfigFile`/`RunnerConfig`,
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env-var passthrough in
  `AnthropicProvider::with_base_url`, and a trailing-`/v1` strip
  so users can paste `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` verbatim.
- [x] **Setup writes a complete `.env`.** Auth step now persists
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
  `IRONCLAW_DATA_DIR`, `ICLAW_SOCKET`, and the
  `IRONCLAW_DEFAULT_IMAGE_TAG` from the image build step. Host
  auto-loads `.env` from the platform install root before falling
  back to CWD-dotenv, so `ironclaw run` works from any cwd.
- [x] **Container manager** — new `ironclaw_host::container_manager`
  module. Polls `sessions` every 1s; for any row with
  `container_status='stopped'` and `messages_in.count_due > 0`,
  writes a `runner.json` (mirrored `RunnerConfigFile` schema) into
  the session dir and calls `runtime.spawn` with the right env /
  bind / labels / entrypoint. 6 unit tests + a `NoopRuntime`
  `spawn_calls()` introspection helper.
- [x] **Image bakes the runner binary.** Setup's image step finds
  `ironclaw-runner` next to its own exe (or via
  `IRONCLAW_RUNNER_BIN` / `PATH`) and copies it into the image at
  `/usr/local/bin/ironclaw-runner`. Image fingerprint includes
  the binary bytes, so re-cargo-build → re-image-build is
  automatic.
- [x] **Router seeds `session_routing`.** On session create the
  router now writes `(channel_type, platform_id, thread_id)` from
  the inbound event into the per-session `session_routing` table.
  Without this the delivery loop marked every outbound `NoRoute`
  because the runner emits text with no explicit destination.
- [x] **`ApprovalsModule` pre-seeded with `cli:local`.** The cli
  channel's only sender is the operator running `ironclaw run`,
  not a remote identity that warrants approval. Boot now
  constructs `ApprovalsModule::with_initial_approved` with the
  `cli:local` identity baked in; everything else still flows
  through the unregistered-sender gate.
- [x] **Stale `container_status=running` reset on boot.** After
  `cleanup_orphans` removes leftover containers from a prior run,
  the host now walks `sessions::list_running` and resets each to
  `stopped` so the manager respawns them. Without this, sessions
  that were running when the host died sat un-handled forever.
- [x] **Runner opens `inbound.db` RW.** The poll loop calls
  `messages_in::mark_completed` (an UPDATE) after every turn, but
  the runner was opening inbound via the RO `open_inbound_ro_no_mmap`
  helper, so the update silently no-op'd and the same message was
  reprocessed every poll. Added a sibling `open_inbound_rw_no_mmap`
  (same no-mmap WAL avoidance, RW) and switched the runner's
  `main.rs` to use it.

**Verified live** against OpenRouter from this host:

    > What's the capital of France? One word only.
    agent> Paris

    > Reply with just a haiku about containers.
    agent> Boxes hold the world,
           Isolated, yet deployed—
           Code sails everywhere.

Each prompt produced exactly one reply; the inbound rows were
marked `completed`; the same session container served every turn.

**Slice totals:** 4365 passing, 0 failing. Clippy clean. The drop
from 4564 → 4365 is the whatsapp crate removal; the rest of the
workspace gained ~185 tests across the manager + provider + setup
changes.

### M13 — Operational hardening (TODO)

End-to-end chat works, but standing up a production install
exposes gaps the earlier milestones never touched. Items in this
slice are required before a 0.1.0 release feels honest.

#### Container lifecycle

- [ ] **Idle-stop**. Sessions keep their container running until
  host shutdown. Need a configurable idle window (default 5 min)
  after which the manager calls `runtime.stop(name, grace)` and
  flips `container_status=idle`. Next inbound respawns.
- [ ] **Crash-restart**. When a container exits non-zero outside
  the idle path, the manager should detect (via the heartbeat
  file's missing/stale mtime, which sweep already surfaces as
  `heartbeat_stale`) and respawn after backoff.
- [ ] **Sweep ↔ manager wiring**. Sweep's `SweepReport` already
  carries `heartbeat_stale` counts but nothing acts on them. Wire
  sweep to mark stale sessions back to `stopped` so the manager
  picks them up.
- [ ] **Per-group resource caps**. `ContainerSpec` doesn't carry
  cpu / memory / pids / network limits. Add them, plumb through
  `container_configs.resource_limits` JSON, and apply at spawn.
- [ ] **Image rebuild on `container_config` change**. When a user
  updates `container_configs.packages_apt` or
  `container_configs.skills`, the manager should rebuild that
  group's image before the next spawn rather than reusing the
  default sha-tagged image.

#### Observability

- [ ] **`iclaw health` / `/healthz`**. One-shot status: host
  uptime, image tag, n running containers, n active sessions,
  last delivery error timestamp, last provider error timestamp.
  Either a new `iclaw` subcommand or a Unix-socket admin verb;
  the existing `iclaw status` is a list view, not a health
  probe.
- [ ] **Prometheus metrics endpoint**. Counters for
  `messages_inbound_total`, `messages_outbound_total`,
  `containers_spawned_total`, `containers_crashed_total`,
  `delivery_failed_total`; histograms for
  `llm_call_seconds`, `llm_tokens_input`, `llm_tokens_output`,
  `container_spawn_seconds`. Optional bind, default off.
- [ ] **Log rotation**. `chat.log` and `host.log` grow unbounded
  when ironclaw is run as a long-lived daemon; setup's systemd /
  launchd units don't currently wire up logrotate or
  size-capping. Either document the recommended logrotate config
  or use `tracing-appender::rolling`.
- [ ] **Audit log of iclaw socket actions**. Every mutation
  (`groups.create`, `messaging-groups.upsert`, `wirings.create`,
  etc.) lands in a new `audit_log` table with caller, command,
  args, and result. Read-paths excluded.

#### Cost and safety

- [ ] **Token accounting**. The runner already sees Anthropic's
  `usage.input_tokens`/`usage.output_tokens` per turn — record
  them in a new `agent_turns` table keyed by session + sequence.
  Required for any per-group budget.
- [ ] **Per-group budgets**. `container_configs.daily_token_cap`
  and `daily_cost_cap_usd`; manager refuses to spawn when budget
  is exhausted and surfaces a "budget exhausted" `System` row on
  the next inbound.
- [ ] **Rate limiting**. Per-group max LLM calls per minute /
  hour. Manager throttles spawn rate; runner backs off on 429
  with `Retry-After` (already wired) but the host-side cap is
  missing.

#### Sender approval

- [ ] **`iclaw approvals approve/deny <id>`**. Today the
  `ApprovalsModule` keeps an in-memory `known_senders` list with
  no CLI surface. New users can never be approved without a host
  restart that pre-seeds them. Wire the iclaw approvals
  subcommand to mutate the module's in-memory list AND persist
  to the existing `pending_sender_approvals` /
  `pending_channel_approvals` tables.
- [ ] **Persist `known_senders` across restarts**. The module
  loses its in-memory approvals when the host process restarts.
  Source-of-truth should be the central `users` table (queried
  on each gate evaluation) rather than a Mutex<Vec>.
- [ ] **Approval notifications**. When a sender lands in
  `pending` state, post a deliverable "approve?" prompt through
  the original messaging group so the operator can decide
  in-channel.

#### Reliability

- [ ] **Outbound dead-letter**. After 3 retries the delivery
  loop marks an outbound row `failed` and moves on. Need a
  `dropped_messages` flow (table already exists) so an operator
  can replay or inspect failures.
- [ ] **Central DB backup / restore**. `iclaw db backup <path>`
  + `iclaw db restore <path>`. The central DB is single-file
  SQLite; a backup is a copy under a held WAL checkpoint.
- [ ] **Versioned migrations**. `ironclaw migrate` already
  runs the central migrations but there's no
  schema-version table the host can check on boot to refuse a
  downgrade or warn about an in-progress upgrade.

#### Security

- [ ] **Webhooks TLS termination story**. Every webhook channel
  binds plain HTTP on `127.0.0.1` by default. Production
  deployments need either native TLS (rustls) or documented
  reverse-proxy patterns (Caddy / nginx / Cloudflare Tunnel)
  per channel. Pick one and ship it.
- [ ] **Secret rotation without restart**. Rotating
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` today requires restarting the host so the
  spawned containers pick up the new env. A SIGHUP handler that
  rereads `.env` and re-emits to running containers is the
  minimum viable change.
- [ ] **Container egress allow-list**. Spawned containers can
  reach the whole internet via the host's network. Add a
  `container_configs.egress_allow` list (set of host:port pairs)
  the manager translates into `--add-host` and an in-container
  iptables / nftables rule, or use Docker's network policy
  flags.

#### Setup polish

- [ ] **OpenRouter as a first-class provider in setup**. Today
  the user has to know to set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` themselves.
  Setup should ask "which provider?" with OpenRouter / native
  Anthropic / corporate proxy as choices and write the right
  base URL.
- [ ] **systemd `Restart=on-failure`** in the generated unit, plus
  a `User=` directive matching the install owner. Today the unit
  emits the command line but not the restart policy.
- [ ] **`iclaw chat` shell**. The user-facing chat UX is "echo
  into a FIFO + tail a log" — fine for piping but not a real
  REPL. A small `iclaw chat` subcommand that opens the socket,
  binds to the install's cli channel, and shows replies inline
  would close the loop.

#### Bugs to clean up

- [ ] **Double `sessions/sessions/` path layout**. Host code uses
  `FsSessionRoot::new(cfg.sessions_root())` which produces
  `data_dir/sessions/sessions/<ag>/<session>` — fine but weird.
  Pick one (likely just `data_dir/sessions/<ag>/<session>`) and
  migrate. Container manager already has a comment explaining the
  workaround.
- [ ] **`base_url_does_not_strip_v1_in_the_middle_of_the_path`
  edge case**. Provider strips a trailing `/v1` but a user
  base URL like `https://corp.example/v1` followed by tenant
  segments wouldn't trip the heuristic. Document the rule or
  switch to an explicit `--api-base-no-suffix-append` mode.
- [ ] **Heartbeat-stale detection is logged but not acted on**.
  `sweep_report.heartbeat_stale > 0` is a clear signal a runner
  has died — wire it through to the manager (see "Crash-restart"
  above).
- [ ] **PLAN.md test counts diverge from `cargo test --workspace`**.
  Snapshots in M-section progress lines are written-once and
  drift fast. Move the count to a single line near the top that's
  the only spot that needs an update per slice.

## 0. Context

Ironclaw is a multi-channel Claude-agent runtime:

- The host orchestrates per-session Linux containers; one container per
  session.
- All host ↔ container IPC is **SQLite-on-bind-mount**: each session has
  an `inbound.db` (host writes, container reads) and an `outbound.db`
  (container writes, host reads). A central `ironclaw.db` holds identity,
  wiring, sessions, and configs.
- Channels (Telegram, Slack, Discord, …) feed the router; the router
  resolves a session and writes `messages_in`; the container's poll loop
  calls Claude and writes `messages_out`; the host's delivery loop
  delivers via the channel adapter.

Goal of this plan: define crate boundaries, contracts, milestones, and
team assignments so a swarm of agents can build ironclaw in parallel.

The Anthropic Agent SDK and MCP SDK both have viable Rust counterparts.
`rmcp` is the official MCP Rust SDK (used here). The agent loop itself
is hand-rolled against the Anthropic HTTP API, which is cleaner than
depending on a third-party Rust Agent SDK and gives us full control
over compaction and tool orchestration.

Background loops on host:
  - Active delivery poll (1s, running sessions only)
  - Sweep delivery poll (60s, all active sessions)
  - Host sweep (60s — stuck detection, recurrence, heartbeat sync)
  - CLI Unix socket server (listener for `iclaw`)
```

**Three invariants that must not change:**
1. `inbound.db` uses `journal_mode=DELETE` (WAL's mmap doesn't propagate
   across the Docker bind-mount — silent data loss otherwise).
2. Each SQLite file has exactly one writer process.
3. Sessions are durable; containers are ephemeral. State lives in DBs +
   filesystem, never in process memory beyond debounce/inflight maps.

## 3. Shared types contract (`ironclaw-types`)

This crate is **the contract surface** between all other crates. It has
zero I/O dependencies and must compile fast. Every team consumes it.
**Owner: T1.** Other teams MUST NOT add new types here without T1 review.

```rust
// crates/ironclaw-types/src/lib.rs

pub mod id;
pub mod session;
pub mod message;
pub mod routing;
pub mod channel;
pub mod provider;
pub mod approval;
pub mod schedule;
```

**Required type stubs** (see source for full definitions):

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct AgentGroupId(pub Uuid);
pub struct MessagingGroupId(pub Uuid);
pub struct SessionId(pub Uuid);
pub struct UserId(pub Uuid);
pub struct MessageId(pub Uuid);

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ChannelType(pub String);

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct InboundEvent { /* … */ }

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct InboundMessage { /* … */ }

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct OutboundMessage { /* … */ }

pub enum MessageKind { Chat, Task, Webhook, System, Agent }
pub enum SessionMode { Shared, PerThread, AgentShared }
pub enum ContainerStatus { Idle, Running, Stopped }
pub enum EngageMode { Pattern, Mention, MentionSticky }
```

**Rule**: when in doubt, add the field to the type rather than a sidecar
JSON blob. Typed boundaries beat JSON blobs.

## 4. Database schemas (authoritative)

DB ownership and schemas are fixed for the first port. **Owner: T2.**

### 4.1 Central DB `data/ironclaw.db`

| Table | PK | Unique | FKs | Indexes |

| `container_configs` | `agent_group_id` | — | `agent_groups CASCADE` | — |
| `dropped_messages` | `id` | — | — | — |

### 4.2 Per-session inbound DB

`data/sessions/<agent_group_id>/<session_id>/inbound.db`

**Host writes, container reads.** `PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE` is
mandatory.

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages_in (
  id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  seq          INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  kind         TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp    TEXT NOT NULL,
  status       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  process_after TEXT,
  recurrence   TEXT,
  series_id    TEXT,
  tries        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  trigger      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  platform_id  TEXT,
  channel_type TEXT,
  thread_id    TEXT,
  content      TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_session_id TEXT,
  on_wake      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_in_series ON messages_in(series_id);

CREATE TABLE delivered (

  platform_message_id TEXT,
  status              TEXT NOT NULL,
  delivered_at        TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE destinations (

CREATE TABLE session_routing (
  id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1),
  channel_type  TEXT,
  platform_id   TEXT,
  thread_id     TEXT
);
```

### 4.3 Per-session outbound DB

**Container writes, host reads.**

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages_out (
  id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  seq          INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  in_reply_to  TEXT,
  timestamp    TEXT NOT NULL,
  deliver_after TEXT,
  recurrence   TEXT,
  kind         TEXT NOT NULL,
  platform_id  TEXT,
  channel_type TEXT,
  thread_id    TEXT,
  content      TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE processing_ack (
  message_id     TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  status         TEXT NOT NULL,
  status_changed TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE session_state (
  key        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value      TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE container_state (
  id                       INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1),
  current_tool             TEXT,
  tool_declared_timeout_ms INTEGER,
  tool_started_at          TEXT,
  updated_at               TEXT
);
```

### 4.4 Session folder layout

```
data/sessions/<agent_group_id>/<session_id>/
├── inbound.db
├── outbound.db
├── .heartbeat                 # container touches mtime; host stat()s
├── inbox/<msg_id>/<filename>  # host-extracted attachment files
└── outbox/<msg_id>/<filename> # container-written attachment files
```

**Attachment safety contract** (T2 implements; everyone consumes):
- `safe_attachment_name()` rejects `..`, slashes, leading dots, len>255.
- `extract_to_inbox()` uses `O_EXCL | O_NOFOLLOW`, refuses symlinks at
  any path component, asserts `realpath(out)` ⊂ session inbox root.
- Mirror for `read_from_outbox()`.

## 5. Wire contracts between subsystems

### 5.1 Channel adapter trait

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait ChannelAdapter: Send + Sync {
    fn channel_type(&self) -> &ChannelType;
    fn supports_threads(&self) -> bool { false }

    async fn subscribe(&self, platform_id: &str, thread_id: Option<&str>) -> Result<(), AdapterError> { Ok(()) }
    async fn set_typing(&self, platform_id: &str, thread_id: Option<&str>) -> Result<(), AdapterError> { Ok(()) }
    async fn deliver(&self, platform_id: &str, thread_id: Option<&str>, message: &OutboundMessage) -> Result<Option<String>, AdapterError>;
    async fn open_dm(&self, _user_id: &str) -> Result<Option<DmHandle>, AdapterError> { Ok(None) }
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait ChannelFactory: Send + Sync {
    fn channel_type(&self) -> ChannelType;
    async fn init(&self, setup: ChannelSetup) -> Result<Arc<dyn ChannelAdapter>, AdapterError>;
    async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<(), AdapterError> { Ok(()) }
    fn container_contribution(&self) -> ContainerContribution { ContainerContribution::default() }
}
```

### 5.2 Provider trait

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AgentProvider: Send + Sync {
    fn supports_native_slash_commands(&self) -> bool { false }
    async fn query(&self, input: QueryInput) -> Result<Box<dyn AgentQuery>, ProviderError>;
    fn is_session_invalid(&self, err: &ProviderError) -> bool { false }
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait AgentQuery: Send {
    async fn push(&mut self, message: String) -> Result<(), ProviderError>;
    async fn end(&mut self) -> Result<(), ProviderError>;
    async fn next_event(&mut self) -> Option<ProviderEvent>;
    async fn abort(&mut self);
}

pub enum ProviderEvent {
    Init { continuation: String },
    Result { text: Option<String> },
    Error { message: String, retryable: bool },
    Progress { message: String },
    Activity,
    ToolStart { name: String, declared_timeout_ms: Option<u64> },
    ToolEnd,
}
```

### 5.3 Module hook surface

```rust
pub struct HostContext { /* … */ }
impl HostContext {
    pub fn set_sender_resolver(&self, f: Arc<dyn Fn(&InboundEvent) -> Option<UserId> + Send + Sync>);
    pub fn set_access_gate(&self, f: Arc<dyn Fn(GateCtx) -> GateDecision + Send + Sync>);
    pub fn set_sender_scope_gate(&self, f: ...);
    pub fn set_message_interceptor(&self, f: ...);
    pub fn set_channel_request_gate(&self, f: ...);
    pub fn register_delivery_action(&self, name: &str, h: Arc<dyn DeliveryActionHandler>);
    pub fn on_delivery_adapter_ready(&self, cb: Arc<dyn Fn(&dyn DeliveryDispatcher) + Send + Sync>);
}
```

### 5.4 `iclaw` Unix-socket wire protocol

JSON, newline-delimited, request-response, half-close per request.
Lives at `data/iclaw.sock` (mode `0o600`).

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(tag = "kind", rename_all = "kebab-case")]
pub enum Request {
    Call { id: String, command: String, args: serde_json::Value, caller: Caller },
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum Caller {
    Host,
    Agent { session_id: SessionId, agent_group_id: AgentGroupId, messaging_group_id: Option<MessagingGroupId> },
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum Response {
    Ok { id: String, data: serde_json::Value },
    Err { id: String, error: ErrorPayload },
}
```

Agent caller comes through the **session DBs** (container-side `iclaw`
writes a `cli_request` system message; container poll loop forwards to
host; host writes the response back), not through the socket.

### 5.5 Container-runner spawn contract

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait ContainerRuntime: Send + Sync {
    async fn ensure_running(&self) -> Result<(), RtError>;
    async fn cleanup_orphans(&self, install_slug: &str) -> Result<(), RtError>;
    async fn spawn(&self, spec: ContainerSpec) -> Result<ContainerHandle, RtError>;
    async fn stop(&self, name: &str, grace: Duration) -> Result<(), RtError>;
    async fn build_image(&self, spec: ImageBuildSpec) -> Result<String, RtError>;
}

pub struct ContainerSpec {
    pub name: String,
    pub image: String,
    pub labels: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub env: Vec<(String, String)>,
    pub mounts: Vec<Mount>,
    pub entrypoint: Vec<String>,
    pub user: Option<String>,
    pub extra_hosts: Vec<(String, String)>,
}
```

Backends: `DockerRuntime` (via `bollard`) and `AppleContainerRuntime`
(spawn `container` CLI; same trait).

## 6. Team assignments

Each team is a parallel work stream. **Dependencies are explicit** — a
team can begin once its dependencies' contracts are merged, even if
those teams aren't done implementing.

### T1 — `ironclaw-types` (gate; serial)

Shared types + serde + enum kinds. No I/O. Acceptance: all types in
§ 3 compile; serde round-trip tests; no tokio/reqwest/rusqlite deps.

### T2 — `ironclaw-db`

Depends on T1. Central DB + per-session DB layer, migrations,
attachment safety. Acceptance: migrations apply cleanly; per-table
CRUD round-trip; property test for seq parity; cross-mount visibility
test.

### T3 — host + host-router + host-delivery + host-sweep

Depends on T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7. Host orchestrator with the boot
sequence, router, delivery loops, and sweep.

**Constants**: `ACTIVE_POLL_MS=1000`, `SWEEP_POLL_MS=60_000`,
`ABSOLUTE_CEILING_MS=1_800_000`, `CLAIM_STUCK_MS=60_000`,
`MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS=3`, `MAX_TRIES=5`, `BACKOFF_BASE_MS=5_000`.

### T4 — `ironclaw-container-rt`

Depends on T1. Docker + Apple Container; image build.

### T5 — runner + providers + mcp

Depends on T1, T2. The entire container-side process.

**Poll loop constants**: `POLL_INTERVAL_MS=1000`,
`ACTIVE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=500`.

**Disallowed built-in tools (host owns these)**: `CronCreate`,
`CronDelete`, `CronList`, `ScheduleWakeup`, `AskUserQuestion`,
`EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode`, `EnterWorktree`, `ExitWorktree`.

**Compaction**: when input tokens approach
`model_input_window - safety_margin`, summarize the oldest half of the
transcript via a separate `messages.create` call, archive the
pre-compaction transcript to `outbox/_compactions/<ts>.md`, replace the
summarized chunk with a `compact_boundary` synthetic user message,
continue.

**Session resume**: persist `(message_history, continuation_seq)` to
`outbound.session_state` after every turn; reload on container startup.

### T6 — `ironclaw-channels/*`

Depends on T1, T3 trait. Channels for M7: telegram, slack, discord.
Channels for M8: whatsapp, whatsapp-cloud, signal, deltachat, imessage,
teams, matrix, gchat, webex, linear, github, resend, wechat, emacs, x.

**Pattern contract**: each channel crate exposes
`pub struct <Name>Factory; impl ChannelFactory for <Name>Factory`, and a
`register(reg: &mut ChannelRegistry)` function. No other public API.

### T7 — `ironclaw-modules`

Depends on T1, T2, T3. Sub-modules: typing, mount-security, permissions,
approvals, interactive, scheduling, agent-to-agent, self-mod.

### T8 — `ironclaw-skills`

Depends on T1. Skill discovery (frontmatter parse), per-group override,
container materialization via symlinks.

### T9 — `ironclaw-iclaw`

Depends on T1, T2, T3. See § A2 for subcommand inventory.

### T10 — `ironclaw-setup`

Depends on most other crates. Interactive setup; environment check,
container build, OneCLI init, auth, mounts, service unit, cli-agent,
timezone, channel, verify, first-chat.

### T11 — `ironclaw-onecli`

Depends on T1. OneCLI HTTP client.

## 8. Milestone sequencing

```
M0  Workspace skeleton + T1 types               (gate)
M1  T2 db                                       (gate for everything else)

```

## 9. Verification

### Test-coverage standard (applies to every crate)

**Every public function, type variant, error path, SQL query, trait impl,
and HTTP endpoint must have a test.** A module that ships without coverage
is incomplete work — the step is not done until the tests are in place.

- Per-crate: `cargo build`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`.
- Coverage gate: `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 85`
  (CI-enforced).
- DB code: round-trip every CRUD path against a fresh in-memory or
  `tempfile`-backed database.
- Async loops: use `tokio::time::pause()` + advance to drive time-based
  branches; do not depend on real sleeps.
- HTTP clients: snapshot tests against `wiremock` fixtures.
- Trait abstractions with multiple impls: write a generic test suite that
  runs once per backend.
- T1/T2 types: serde round-trip property tests for every public struct
  and enum variant.
- T3 host: integration tests with stubbed channel + stubbed container.
- T5 runner: integration tests against a mock Anthropic server
  (`wiremock`); end-to-end test with a real Claude API key gated by
  `IRONCLAW_E2E=1`.
- T6 channels: replay tests against captured platform fixtures.

### Cross-crate (M4 onward)
- End-to-end "CLI channel" test: spawn host + container, type a line in
  the CLI channel, see a Claude response.
- Skill mount test: verify expected skills appear in container.
- Sweep test: artificially stall a container, observe kill+restart.

## 10. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Channel platform APIs underestimated.** Each is bespoke. | High | High | Budget ~1 team-week per channel beyond the first three. |
| **Anthropic streaming/tool-use loop bugs.** | High | High | Snapshot tests against a mock server before live API. |
| **Cross-mount SQLite visibility regression.** | Medium | High | Dedicated cross-mount visibility test; enforce `journal_mode=DELETE` in code. |
| **Compaction divergence.** | Medium | Medium | Configurable strategy; ship "summarize oldest half" in M3, refine later. |
| **`rmcp` API churn.** | Low | Medium | Pin minor version; vendor or fork if needed. |
| **`bollard` Docker API drift.** | Low | Medium | Pin engine API version 1.43+. |
| **OneCLI is a moving target.** | Medium | Medium | Wrap behind T11's trait so we can stub or swap. |

## Implementation invariants

Load-bearing properties of this codebase that are convention rather than enforced by types or DB constraints. Any new write path must respect them; any change here is a breaking change.

- **Seq parity is convention, not constraint.** Host writes even `seq` to `messages_in`; container writes odd `seq` to `messages_out`. The DB does not enforce parity — two helper functions do. New write paths must preserve parity or two writers will collide on edits.
- **Heartbeat liveness uses file mtime, not DB queries.** The host `stat()`s `<session>/.heartbeat`; the container touches it. Switching to a DB-backed liveness would re-introduce the cross-mount visibility hazard `journal_mode=DELETE` exists to prevent.
- **Destinations are dual-written.** Approvals + group-membership mutations land in both the central DB and the per-session DB inside the same router call. Don't lazy-sync — stale destinations are how cross-channel messages get sent to the wrong place.
- **Wake messages bypass debounce.** The `on_wake = 1` column on `messages_in` is processed once at container boot regardless of recurrence state; it is how the host hands over in-flight context to a freshly-spawned container without racing the poll loop.
- **Per-install service slug.** systemd / launchd unit names are SHA1-suffixed by project root so a developer can run two installs side-by-side without one stomping the other's `iclaw.sock`.
- **Single-writer per SQLite file.** Inbound DB: host writes only. Outbound DB: container writes only. Central DB: host process only. Every test that opens a writer outside the owning process must use `open_inbound_ro_no_mmap` or equivalent.

## Future work

Items deliberately deferred from 0.1.0; tracked here so they don't get rediscovered.

- **Scheduled tasks table.** A first-class `scheduled_tasks` table for recurring agent jobs (independent of the per-message `recurrence` column). The MCP `schedule_task` tool currently writes into `messages_in` with a recurrence and a `process_after`; a dedicated table would let us list/cancel without scanning the message log.
- **WhatsApp Signal Protocol session state.** The Curve25519 / Ed25519 / HKDF / AES-GCM primitives in `crates/ironclaw-channels/whatsapp/src/crypto/dalek.rs` are RFC-tested and ready. What sits above them — X3DH key agreement, the Double Ratchet, Sender Keys for group chat, the WA wire-envelope construction — is the next-contributor task. Adapter `deliver()` surfaces a distinct error message so the gap is testable.
- **Docker Sandbox runtime backend.** A third `ContainerRuntime` impl using a micro-VM (`firecracker`, `cloud-hypervisor`, or Apple's `Virtualization.framework`) for installations that want a stronger isolation boundary than a Docker container.
- **Replay-fixture harness.** Designed in `docs/replay-fixtures.md`; the in-tree `crates/ironclaw-host/tests/replay/` module and the first round of captured fixtures are the M11 acceptance gate.
