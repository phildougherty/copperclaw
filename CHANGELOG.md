# Changelog

All notable changes to Ironclaw are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (failure-mode replay fixtures)

- Three new fixtures under `fixtures/cli/` that exercise the runner's
  and host's failure modes deterministically:
  - **`empty-llm-response/`** — LLM returns a successful turn with no
    content blocks. Pins the `drive_turn` no-content branch: inbound
    completes, usage_report is still written, no chat outbound emitted.
    Active in `replay.rs`.
  - **`provider-5xx-retry/`** — first `/v1/messages` call returns 503,
    second succeeds. Documents the post-retry shape an eventual
    `provider.query()` retry loop should land. `#[ignore]`d in
    `replay.rs` until that retry exists.
  - **`provider-timeout/`** — provider hangs past the per-call budget.
    Documents the give-up-and-mark-failed shape an eventual runner-side
    deadline should land. `#[ignore]`d in `replay.rs` until that
    deadline exists.
- **`crates/ironclaw-host/tests/replay/fixture.rs`** — new optional
  `provider_responses` array on the fixture manifest. Each entry is one
  scripted response: `{"kind": "success", "file": "001-turn.json"}`,
  `{"kind": "error", "status": 503}`, or
  `{"kind": "timeout", "delay_ms": 60000}`. When absent, the harness
  keeps the legacy "i-th `claude/NNN-turn.json` for the i-th request"
  behaviour, so existing fixtures stay untouched.
- **`crates/ironclaw-host/tests/replay/harness.rs`** — honours the new
  field via `mount_provider_responses`, and now captures (instead of
  panicking on) per-turn `run_loop` errors so failure-mode fixtures
  can snapshot post-state even when the runner bails. Three new
  `#[tokio::test]` entries in `replay.rs`.

### Added (E2E chat round-trip integration test)

- **`crates/ironclaw-host/tests/e2e_chat.rs`** — boots
  `ironclaw_host::run_host` in-process against a tempdir install root,
  mounts a `wiremock` Anthropic-flavoured streaming stub, writes
  `"hello\n"` into the cli channel's real FIFO, and asserts the mocked
  reply (`"hi from the mock"`) appears in `<install_root>/chat.log`.
  The host's container manager is left disabled and an in-process
  runner driver (mirroring `replay/harness.rs`'s seam) processes
  inbound for each new session, so the test runs without Docker or
  network access. A second smaller test drives `iclaw chat
  --no-autostart` via `ironclaw_iclaw::run_cli` against a missing
  FIFO and asserts the friendly "run `ironclaw start`" hint. This
  pair is the gate that would have caught the FIFO-vs-stdin wiring
  bug that motivated M11.

### Added (setup wizard e2e harness)

- **End-to-end wizard integration test** at
  `crates/ironclaw-setup/tests/wizard_e2e.rs`. Drives the full step
  loop against a fresh `tempfile::tempdir` and asserts the install
  layout an operator would actually rely on: central DB migrated to
  `expected_central_schema_version()`, `.env` with the right keys at
  mode `0600`, `chat.fifo` is a FIFO, `chat.log` is a regular file at
  mode `0600`, `setup-state.json` records the completed steps, and the
  central DB has exactly one agent group + `(cli, stdin)` messaging
  group + wiring. Four scenarios: happy path, idempotent re-run,
  partial-failure recovery (auth step fails on a read-only data dir,
  then resumes after the lock is lifted), and downgrade refusal
  (manually bumping `schema_version` past the binary's expected count
  must surface a schema-mismatch error). Skips the container-image
  build and runs with `service_scope=print` so no real systemd /
  launchd units are touched.

### Changed (setup wizard schema-mismatch guard)

- **`central_db` step now refuses to run against a future schema.**
  Mirrors `ironclaw_host::boot::check_schema_version`: if the on-disk
  `schema_version` table reports more applied migrations than
  `expected_central_schema_version()`, the step returns an error
  rather than silently running migrations against a DB that was
  migrated by a newer binary. This protects operators who try to
  downgrade ironclaw without restoring from a backup.

### Added (install.sh integration test)

- **Containerised integration test for `install.sh`** at
  `tests/install/test_install_sh.sh`.  Spins up a clean Ubuntu 24.04
  container, mounts the repo read-only, and drives the installer
  through four scenarios: (1) missing-Docker clean-failure path,
  (2) full binary install via `cargo install --path` (opt-in via
  `IRONCLAW_INSTALL_TEST_RUN_BUILD=1`; default-skipped because it
  adds ~5 minutes), (3) re-run idempotency — pre-existing binaries
  survive a dry-run re-invocation, (4) platform detection across all
  four supported triples plus an explicit `IRONCLAW_RELEASE_TAG`.
  Default suite runtime: ~3 s after the image is cached.
- New CI job `install-sh` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the
  suite on `ubuntu-latest` and shellchecks both files, with a
  path-filter (`install.sh`, `tests/install/**`, the workflow
  itself) so the job is skipped on unrelated PRs.
- Three test-only escape hatches added to `install.sh`,
  default-off and silent unless explicitly set:
  `INSTALL_SH_SKIP_DOCKER_CHECK=1` skips the container-runtime
  check; `IRONCLAW_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1` prints the tarball URL the
  installer would fetch and exits 0; `IRONCLAW_FORCE_TARGET=<triple>`
  overrides platform detection for the URL test.

### Added (replay fixture coverage)

- **Three new replay fixtures** under `fixtures/`:
  `telegram/inbound-text-message/`, `slack/event-message/`, and
  `cli/multi-turn/`. Each runs through the existing in-process
  `ReplayHarness` in `crates/ironclaw-host/tests/replay.rs`. The
  telegram and slack fixtures exercise the inbound -> router ->
  runner -> outbound -> delivery pipeline for those channel types
  (against `MockAdapter`s pre-registered in the harness), and
  `cli/multi-turn` drives two inbound chat lines and two Claude turns
  through a single shared session to assert runner state continuity.
- **Harness now pre-registers a `MockAdapter` for each known channel
  type** (`cli`, `telegram`, `slack`, plus whatever the fixture
  manifest names if it falls outside that list) and aggregates
  `deliver()` calls across them. `expected/delivered.jsonl` rows now
  include a `channel_type` field so multi-channel fixtures can assert
  per-channel routing.
- **Harness test entry points are deduplicated** behind a single
  `run_fixture(channel, scenario)` helper. Adding a new fixture is
  now a one-line `#[tokio::test]` in `crates/ironclaw-host/tests/replay.rs`.

### Fixed (cli channel bridge)

- **`iclaw chat` now actually reaches the host.** The cli channel
  adapter previously read from the host process's own `tokio::io::stdin()`
  and wrote outbound replies to `tokio::io::stdout()` — so messages
  typed into `iclaw chat` (which wrote to `<install_root>/chat.fifo`)
  were never picked up, and replies were never appended to
  `<install_root>/chat.log` for the chat tailing loop to see. The
  adapter gains a FIFO/log mode: when `IRONCLAW_CLI_FIFO` and/or
  `IRONCLAW_CLI_LOG` are set (or defaulted from `IRONCLAW_DATA_DIR`'s
  parent), the cli channel opens the FIFO with `O_RDWR | O_NONBLOCK`
  via `tokio::net::unix::pipe::Receiver` and appends outbound to the
  log, flushing each line. The `O_RDWR` open is the standard
  "reader is its own writer" trick that keeps the pipe alive across
  external-writer disconnects (Ctrl-D in one `iclaw chat` no longer
  EOFs the host's read side). With no paths configured the adapter
  still falls back to stdin/stdout for the developer REPL.
- **Setup wires the bridge by default.** `ironclaw-setup`'s
  `quickstart_group` step now also `mkfifo`s `chat.fifo` (0600),
  touches `chat.log` (0600), and writes `IRONCLAW_CLI_FIFO` and
  `IRONCLAW_CLI_LOG` lines into the install's `.env` so the host
  picks them up on next boot. Idempotent — re-running setup leaves
  an existing FIFO / log / env line alone.
- **Stray blank lines are no longer reified into `{"text":""}`
  inbound events.** The cli channel's read loop now skips empty
  lines, eliminating the spurious empty-message inbound that the
  original buggy stdin path produced when a terminal flushed a
  newline.

### Added (release automation)

- **Binary release workflow** at `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
  Triggered by `git push` of a `v*` tag (and manually via
  `workflow_dispatch` for smoke tests). Builds `ironclaw`, `iclaw`,
  and `ironclaw-setup` in parallel for four targets
  (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
  `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`), strips each
  binary, packages one `ironclaw-<target>.tar.gz` per target with
  binaries at the top level (the layout `install.sh` expects),
  generates a combined `SHA256SUMS`, extracts release notes from
  `CHANGELOG.md` for the tagged version, and publishes a GitHub
  Release with the tarballs + `SHA256SUMS` attached. Linux arm64
  is cross-compiled with the apt `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` linker;
  macOS x86_64 is cross-compiled on the `macos-14` arm64 runner.
  Co-exists with the container-image workflow so one tag push
  cuts both the binary release and the GHCR image.
- `install.sh`'s prebuilt-tarball strategy now actually resolves
  on tagged releases — no more silent fallback to `cargo install
  --git` for every install.

### Added (production hardening slice — three parallel-agent items)

- **Secret rotation via SIGHUP.** New `RotatableConfig` struct +
  `Arc<RwLock<...>>` on `ContainerManager` holds the rotatable
  surface (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, web-search
  provider keys). `ContainerManager::reload_env(env_file)` parses
  the `.env` and updates the lock so subsequent container spawns
  pick up rotated values. SIGHUP handler wired in
  `wait_for_signal_or_sighup`; `run_host` gains an `env_file`
  parameter that the SIGHUP handler reads on each signal. New
  metric `ironclaw_secrets_rotated_total`. Running containers see
  rotated keys after idle-stop + respawn (default 5 min).
- **Webhooks TLS documentation.** New
  [`docs/webhooks-tls.md`](docs/webhooks-tls.md) covers the
  reverse-proxy patterns (Caddy / nginx / Cloudflare Tunnel) and
  explains why native rustls is deliberately not in 0.1.0.
- **Per-group LLM rate limits.** New columns
  `agent_turns_per_minute_cap` + `agent_turns_per_hour_cap` on
  `group_budgets` (migration `009_rate_limit_caps`). Container
  manager gates spawn on both windows in `maybe_spawn`; an
  in-channel reply explains the cap via the same outbound-write
  path the budget gate uses, dedup'd on a 1-minute window. New
  `iclaw budgets set --turns-per-minute N --turns-per-hour N`.
- **Versioned migrations.** New `expected_central_schema_version()`
  and `applied_central_schema_version()` helpers in
  `ironclaw-db::migrate`. Boot now refuses to start with
  `BootError::SchemaMismatch` (exit code 5) when the on-disk
  schema is newer than this binary expects (downgrade detection).
  New `iclaw schema-version` subcommand prints `{expected, applied,
  status}` as JSON.
- **`sessions/sessions/` path cleanup.** `HostConfig::sessions_root()`
  now returns `data_dir` directly; the double-`sessions/` layout
  is gone. New `migrate_sessions_layout()` runs at boot, moving
  contents from `data_dir/sessions/sessions/<ag>/<sess>/` up one
  level when present. Collisions log a warn and skip; the inner
  directory is only removed when all entries moved successfully.

### Added (onboarding polish slice)

- `iclaw doctor` — first-run / ongoing health probe. Walks the
  install end-to-end (host reachability, agent groups, wirings,
  active sessions, recent audit errors, dropped-message backlog,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` presence, web-search provider keys) and
  prints a per-row OK / WARN / FAIL with a `fix:` line on every
  non-OK row. Non-zero exit when any check is in FAIL so CI scripts
  can branch. `--json` for machine-readable output, `--no-ping` to
  skip the live LLM ping.
- Setup auto-bootstraps a default cli agent group + wiring. New
  `quickstart_group` step runs after `verify` and writes a
  `(cli, stdin)` messaging group + agent group + pattern-`.*`
  wiring directly to the central DB so `iclaw chat` works on the
  very first `ironclaw run`. Idempotent (skips when any agent group
  already exists). Opt out with `IRONCLAW_SETUP_QUICKSTART=no` or
  decline the interactive prompt. Override the slug with
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_QUICKSTART_NAME`. The `first_chat` step's
  "what to do next" output flips to recommend `iclaw chat`
  directly when the bootstrap landed.
- Budget-exhausted reply to original sender. When the container
  manager's spawn gate refuses because today's tokens exceeded
  the group's `daily_token_cap`, the host now posts a one-line
  in-channel reply ("I have reached this agent's daily token
  budget. New requests will resume after &lt;next UTC midnight&gt;…") via
  the session's `outbound.db`. Dedupes per-group on a one-hour
  window so a chatty user gets one explanation, not ten. Skips
  silently when `session_routing` is empty.

### Added (M14 follow-up — web search)

- New `web_search` MCP tool, the 20th in-tree tool the agent can
  call. Closes the M14 follow-up gap: `web_fetch` could read a URL
  but the agent couldn't *find* one.
- Four provider backends in a single tool, normalised to one
  `{title, url, snippet, published?, score?}` result schema:
  - **Tavily** — agent-tuned default. `TAVILY_API_KEY`.
  - **Exa** — neural / semantic search with `text` snippets.
    `EXA_API_KEY`.
  - **Brave** — independent keyword index. `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`.
  - **SerpAPI** — Google / Bing / etc. wrapper. `SERPAPI_API_KEY`.
- Provider resolution: explicit `provider` arg → `IRONCLAW_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER`
  env → auto-detect from configured keys in order
  `tavily, exa, brave, serpapi`. No keys configured surfaces a
  validation error naming all four env vars (errors over silent
  fallback).
- Host's `ContainerManager` now forwards
  `IRONCLAW_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER` + the four provider keys into the
  session container at spawn via a new `forward_env` field, so the
  operator only configures keys once in the host's `.env`.
- New skill: `skills/web-search/SKILL.md` (auto-loaded into the
  system prompt under the existing
  `IRONCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` mechanism).
- New doc: [`docs/web-search.md`](docs/web-search.md) — operator
  setup, provider trade-offs, egress allow-list interaction.

### Added (M14 — agent capability)

- `ProviderEvent::ToolCall` and a tool-use outer loop in the runner.
  The model now actually receives the schema for every in-tree tool
  and can call them per turn until it produces a turn without tool
  use (capped at 20 inner LLM rounds).
- Four computer-use tools wired through to the agent: `shell` (bash
  in container, 64 KiB output cap, 60 s default / 600 s ceiling),
  `read_file` (UTF-8 read, 1 MiB cap), `write_file` (create/append
  with auto-mkdir), `web_fetch` (HTTP GET/POST, 256 KiB body cap,
  30 s default / 120 s ceiling).
- Skill content auto-loaded into the agent's system prompt.
  `IRONCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` points at the SKILL.md library, optional
  `IRONCLAW_GROUPS_DIR` enables per-agent-group overrides under
  `<groups_dir>/<ag_uuid>/skills/`. Setup writes both env vars.
- New skills documenting the computer-use tools: `shell`,
  `read-file`, `write-file`, `web-fetch`.

### Added (M13 hardening — parallel-agent slice)

- **Image rebuild on `container_configs` change.** The manager
  fingerprints (`config_fingerprint` column) the rebuild-relevant
  fields and rebuilds + retags before the next spawn when they
  change. Rebuild failures log + emit
  `ironclaw_image_rebuild_failed_total` and fall back to the
  last-known-good image so the agent group is not blocked.
- **Container egress allow-list.** New
  `container_configs.egress_allow` (JSON array of host:port).
  Default empty == allow-all (default-allow + opt-in lockdown).
  Docker runtime translates to user-defined network policy; Apple
  Container runtime returns `RtError::Unsupported`. New
  `iclaw groups config set-egress-allow <id> --allow host:port ...`.
- **Per-group resource caps.** New
  `container_configs.resource_limits` JSON
  (`cpus` / `memory_mb` / `pids_limit`, all optional). Docker
  runtime applies via `--cpus` / `--memory` / `--pids-limit`. New
  `iclaw groups config set-resource-limits`.
- **Auto-applied `install_packages` / `add_mcp_server`.** The
  delivery loop now intercepts these system actions and writes
  directly to `container_configs.packages_apt` /
  `packages_npm` / `mcp_servers`. Combined with the rebuild
  fingerprint, the next spawn picks up the agent's tool calls
  automatically — no operator step required.
- **Central DB backup / restore.** `iclaw db backup <path>` runs
  a WAL checkpoint and atomically copies the file. `iclaw db
  restore <path>` always refuses with `host_running`; the
  operator-facing procedure is documented in
  `docs/db-backup.md` (stop host, copy file, restart).
- **Outbound dead-letter replay.** New
  `outbound_dropped_messages` table (migration `008_*`). Delivery
  failures that exhaust 3 retries land here.
  `iclaw dropped-messages outbound-list --since <window>` and
  `iclaw dropped-messages replay <id>` give the operator
  inspection / retry.
- **MCP server preset registry.** `iclaw mcp list-presets` shows
  the curated library (postgres, linear, github, notion,
  filesystem, browserbase). `iclaw mcp add <preset>
  --agent-group-id <id> --env K=V` writes the chosen preset into
  `container_configs.mcp_servers` (env values are redacted in the
  audit log).
- **Sender approval notifications in-channel.** When a new sender
  lands in `pending` for the first time, the host posts a plain-
  ASCII "approve?" notification to the agent group's primary
  messaging group. Dedup uses `unregistered_senders` so repeat
  senders don't re-spam.
- **Prometheus metrics endpoint.** Opt-in via
  `IRONCLAW_METRICS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9090` (bare port auto-prefixes
  to loopback). Counters:
  `ironclaw_messages_inbound_total{channel_type}`,
  `ironclaw_messages_outbound_total{channel_type}`,
  `ironclaw_containers_spawned_total`,
  `ironclaw_containers_crashed_total`,
  `ironclaw_delivery_failed_total{channel_type}`,
  `ironclaw_image_rebuild_failed_total`. Histograms:
  `ironclaw_llm_call_seconds`, `ironclaw_llm_tokens_input`,
  `ironclaw_llm_tokens_output`, `ironclaw_container_spawn_seconds`.
  New crate `ironclaw-metrics`.
- **Log rotation.** Opt-in via `IRONCLAW_LOG_DIR=<path>`. Adds a
  daily-rotating file writer (`host.log.<YYYY-MM-DD>`) alongside
  the existing stderr writer. `IRONCLAW_LOG` filter applies to
  both. Default stderr-only behaviour unchanged.
- **Audit-log env redaction.** The host's audit dispatch now masks
  values under any `env` block for `mcp.add` and
  `groups.config.set-mcp-servers` before serialising into
  `audit_log.args`. Keys are preserved; values become
  `<redacted>`.
- New docs: [`docs/container-config.md`](docs/container-config.md),
  [`docs/observability.md`](docs/observability.md),
  [`docs/db-backup.md`](docs/db-backup.md).

### Added

- One-command installer at `install.sh`: detects platform (Linux
  x86_64/aarch64, macOS arm64/x86_64), verifies Docker or Podman is
  reachable, then installs `ironclaw`, `iclaw`, and `ironclaw-setup`
  to `~/.local/bin` — preferring a prebuilt release tarball, falling
  back to `cargo install --git`, and finally `cargo install --path`
  when run inside a checkout. Re-running detects an existing install
  and offers upgrade/skip; setup state is resumed in place. Respects
  `NO_COLOR`, non-tty stdout, and quiets verbose output unless
  something fails.
- README "Install" section now leads with the one-liner; the
  longstanding `cargo build` instructions move under a "Manual install"
  subsection.
- One-terminal operator flow for the `ironclaw` binary: new
  `ironclaw start` (daemonize, write PID file, wait for admin socket
  ready), `ironclaw stop` (SIGTERM with SIGKILL escalation after a
  10s grace), `ironclaw status [--json]` (PID, uptime, paths, active
  session count; exits non-zero when not running for CI use), and
  `ironclaw logs [-f] [-n N]` (tail the host log). `ironclaw run`
  is preserved for foreground / service-managed deployments.
- `iclaw chat` now auto-starts the host via `ironclaw start` when
  the chat FIFO is missing; pass `--no-autostart` to keep the old
  "fail loudly" behaviour for scripted / CI use. Quick start
  collapses to `ironclaw start && iclaw chat` in one terminal.
- Interactive Telegram pairing wizard inside `ironclaw-setup`'s
  `channel` step. When the operator picks `telegram`, the wizard walks
  them through `@BotFather`, validates the token format
  (`^\d+:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`), verifies it via Telegram's `getMe`
  endpoint (10 s timeout, soft-fail on network errors), optionally
  polls `getUpdates` for ~60 s to capture the first chat id, and
  appends `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to the data-dir
  `.env`. Headless mode is driven by
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Tokens are never logged — the
  audit messages use `<digits>:****<last-4>` redaction.
- `ironclaw-setup` `service_unit` step now installs and enables the
  generated systemd unit / launchd plist end-to-end rather than just
  writing it to disk. Operators pick a scope at the prompt
  (`system` / `user` / `print`) or via
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_SERVICE_SCOPE`; `IRONCLAW_SETUP_SERVICE_ENABLE`
  controls whether `systemctl enable --now` / `launchctl bootstrap`
  fires. The step polls the admin socket for ~10s after enabling and
  prints a clear "service is running" / "didn't come up — check
  journalctl" line. `system` scope refuses to silently shell out to
  `sudo` and falls back to `user` when not root. Idempotent on re-
  run: identical bodies are detected and the step is skipped.
- `iclaw` with no subcommand now prints a one-shot operator dashboard
  (install root, agent groups, wirings, active sessions, recent audit
  + drop activity, 24h budget usage, and up to three heuristic
  next-step suggestions). Fans out to existing read-only handlers in
  parallel via `tokio::join!`; `--json` emits the same payload as a
  single object. When the host socket is unreachable the dashboard
  exits non-zero with a friendly "host not running" pointer.
- `iclaw groups config edit <id>` — opens the container config as
  TOML in `$EDITOR` (falls back to `$VISUAL`, then `vi`), diffs on
  save, and applies the changes via the existing `groups.config.*`
  socket commands. Supports `--dry-run` to preview the diff without
  committing. Read-only fields (`agent_group_id`, `updated_at`) are
  rendered as comments and ignored on save; TOML parse errors are
  re-rendered inline with a `(r)etry / (a)bort` prompt.
- Two guided-flow agent skills under `skills/`: `customize` (walks
  the user through model swaps, package/MCP installs, behavior
  prompt edits, and budget changes, routing host-only mutations to
  the operator with the exact `iclaw` command) and `debug` (pulls
  diagnostics reachable from inside the container and prints the
  `iclaw health` / `audit list` / `dropped-messages list` commands
  the operator must run to complete triage).
- Initial Rust workspace with 16 crates across the host, runner,
  providers, MCP server, modules, skills, container runtime, OneCLI
  gateway, iclaw admin client, and interactive setup.
- Central DB schema (`ironclaw.db`) with idempotent migrations under
  `crates/ironclaw-db/migrations/`. Per-session inbound and outbound DBs
  with attachment-safety helpers (`safe_attachment_name`,
  `extract_to_inbox`, `read_from_outbox`).
- Host pipeline: router (hook chain, fan-out, session resolution),
  delivery (active 1s + sweep 60s, exponential backoff, 3-attempt cap),
  and sweep (stuck detection, recurrence fanout, processing-ack reset).
- Container runtime trait with Docker (bollard) and Apple Container
  (CLI shell-out) backends. Image build with apt/npm package
  contributions per `container_configs` and sha256-fingerprinted tags.
- Provider trait + Anthropic HTTP-streaming impl with tool-use loop and
  context compaction. Subprocess provider variants for Codex and
  OpenCode. Ollama provider via the Anthropic-compatible base URL.
- MCP server with the 15-tool inventory documented in PLAN.md section 7.
- Channel registry with 17 in-tree channels: cli, telegram, slack,
  discord, resend, github, linear, webex, matrix, teams, gchat,
  whatsapp-cloud, signal, deltachat, emacs, x, plus the in-progress
  imessage/wechat/whatsapp crates landing as follow-ups.
- Modules: typing, mount-security, permissions, approvals, interactive,
  scheduling, agent-to-agent, self-mod.
- Skill discovery (frontmatter parse + per-group override) and
  symlink-based container materialisation; 17 authored skills under
  `skills/`.
- `ironclaw-iclaw` Unix-socket admin server inside the host plus the
  `iclaw` client binary; 41 distinct commands exported as
  `ironclaw_iclaw::ALL_COMMANDS`.
- `ironclaw-setup` interactive setup with `dialoguer`, systemd /
  launchd unit generators, headless env-var-driven mode, and the
  `--migrate-from` data-directory migrator.
- `ironclaw-onecli` HTTP credential gateway with full wiremock coverage
  for 401/404/409/429/5xx and `Retry-After` parsing.
- M11 documentation: `docs/cutover.md` for predecessor migration,
  `docs/replay-fixtures.md` describing the differential-testing
  harness, and `docs/release-checklist.md` for cutting tagged
  releases.
- Baseline CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (rustfmt, clippy,
  test on Linux + macOS, coverage gate at 85%).
- `container-image` GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes
  the session base image to GHCR (`ghcr.io/<repo>/session`) for every
  push to `main` (as `:edge`) and tagged release (as `:<semver>` and
  `:latest`), with multi-arch (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) buildx output,
  GHA build cache, and an `ironclaw.fingerprint` provenance label.
- Checked-in `container/Dockerfile` for the session base image, carrying
  an `IRONCLAW_FINGERPRINT` build-arg stamped as an
  `ironclaw.fingerprint=<sha>` LABEL so pulled images can be verified
  against the locally-expected spec hash.
- `ironclaw-setup` `image` step now attempts a `docker pull` of the
  pre-built GHCR image before falling back to a local build. Pulls are
  verified by inspecting the image's `ironclaw.fingerprint` label;
  mismatches fall through to a local build with a clear "pulling
  failed, building locally" message. `IRONCLAW_SETUP_NO_PULL=1` skips
  the pull attempt for air-gapped or reproducible-build use cases;
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_PULL_REGISTRY` overrides the registry slug for forks.

### Fixed

- Matrix `/sync` loop now respects cancellation while pushing inbound
  events, allowing the previously-ignored
  `sync_loop_pushes_events_and_persists_next_batch` test to run
  reliably without saturating the inbound mpsc.

### Known limitations

- Three M8 channels are noted in PLAN.md as the hardest of the set —
  imessage (macOS-local), wechat (Enterprise Work Weixin), and
  whatsapp (native Baileys port). Initial scaffolds are landing in
  follow-up commits; the whatsapp adapter ships behind a stubbed
  `CryptoBackend` until a real Signal-Protocol impl is wired in.
- Differential replay fixtures (M11) are designed in
  `docs/replay-fixtures.md` but the in-tree harness and captured
  fixtures are not yet committed.
