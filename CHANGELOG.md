# Changelog

All notable changes to Ironclaw are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (release automation)

- **Binary release workflow** at `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
  Triggered by `git push` of a `v*` tag (and manually via
  `workflow_dispatch` for smoke tests). Builds `ironclaw`, `iclaw`,
  and `ironclaw-setup` in parallel for four targets
  (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
  `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`), strips each
  binary, packages one `ironclaw-<target>.tar.gz` per target with
  binaries at the top level (the layout `install.sh` expects),
  generates a combined `SHA256SUMS`, extracts release notes from
  `CHANGELOG.md` for the tagged version, and publishes a GitHub
  Release with the tarballs + `SHA256SUMS` attached. Linux arm64
  is cross-compiled with the apt `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` linker;
  macOS x86_64 is cross-compiled on the `macos-14` arm64 runner.
  Co-exists with the container-image workflow so one tag push
  cuts both the binary release and the GHCR image.
- `install.sh`'s prebuilt-tarball strategy now actually resolves
  on tagged releases — no more silent fallback to `cargo install
  --git` for every install.

### Added (production hardening slice — three parallel-agent items)

- **Secret rotation via SIGHUP.** New `RotatableConfig` struct +
  `Arc<RwLock<...>>` on `ContainerManager` holds the rotatable
  surface (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, web-search
  provider keys). `ContainerManager::reload_env(env_file)` parses
  the `.env` and updates the lock so subsequent container spawns
  pick up rotated values. SIGHUP handler wired in
  `wait_for_signal_or_sighup`; `run_host` gains an `env_file`
  parameter that the SIGHUP handler reads on each signal. New
  metric `ironclaw_secrets_rotated_total`. Running containers see
  rotated keys after idle-stop + respawn (default 5 min).
- **Webhooks TLS documentation.** New
  [`docs/webhooks-tls.md`](docs/webhooks-tls.md) covers the
  reverse-proxy patterns (Caddy / nginx / Cloudflare Tunnel) and
  explains why native rustls is deliberately not in 0.1.0.
- **Per-group LLM rate limits.** New columns
  `agent_turns_per_minute_cap` + `agent_turns_per_hour_cap` on
  `group_budgets` (migration `009_rate_limit_caps`). Container
  manager gates spawn on both windows in `maybe_spawn`; an
  in-channel reply explains the cap via the same outbound-write
  path the budget gate uses, dedup'd on a 1-minute window. New
  `iclaw budgets set --turns-per-minute N --turns-per-hour N`.
- **Versioned migrations.** New `expected_central_schema_version()`
  and `applied_central_schema_version()` helpers in
  `ironclaw-db::migrate`. Boot now refuses to start with
  `BootError::SchemaMismatch` (exit code 5) when the on-disk
  schema is newer than this binary expects (downgrade detection).
  New `iclaw schema-version` subcommand prints `{expected, applied,
  status}` as JSON.
- **`sessions/sessions/` path cleanup.** `HostConfig::sessions_root()`
  now returns `data_dir` directly; the double-`sessions/` layout
  is gone. New `migrate_sessions_layout()` runs at boot, moving
  contents from `data_dir/sessions/sessions/<ag>/<sess>/` up one
  level when present. Collisions log a warn and skip; the inner
  directory is only removed when all entries moved successfully.

### Added (onboarding polish slice)

- `iclaw doctor` — first-run / ongoing health probe. Walks the
  install end-to-end (host reachability, agent groups, wirings,
  active sessions, recent audit errors, dropped-message backlog,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` presence, web-search provider keys) and
  prints a per-row OK / WARN / FAIL with a `fix:` line on every
  non-OK row. Non-zero exit when any check is in FAIL so CI scripts
  can branch. `--json` for machine-readable output, `--no-ping` to
  skip the live LLM ping.
- Setup auto-bootstraps a default cli agent group + wiring. New
  `quickstart_group` step runs after `verify` and writes a
  `(cli, stdin)` messaging group + agent group + pattern-`.*`
  wiring directly to the central DB so `iclaw chat` works on the
  very first `ironclaw run`. Idempotent (skips when any agent group
  already exists). Opt out with `IRONCLAW_SETUP_QUICKSTART=no` or
  decline the interactive prompt. Override the slug with
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_QUICKSTART_NAME`. The `first_chat` step's
  "what to do next" output flips to recommend `iclaw chat`
  directly when the bootstrap landed.
- Budget-exhausted reply to original sender. When the container
  manager's spawn gate refuses because today's tokens exceeded
  the group's `daily_token_cap`, the host now posts a one-line
  in-channel reply ("I have reached this agent's daily token
  budget. New requests will resume after &lt;next UTC midnight&gt;…") via
  the session's `outbound.db`. Dedupes per-group on a one-hour
  window so a chatty user gets one explanation, not ten. Skips
  silently when `session_routing` is empty.

### Added (M14 follow-up — web search)

- New `web_search` MCP tool, the 20th in-tree tool the agent can
  call. Closes the M14 follow-up gap: `web_fetch` could read a URL
  but the agent couldn't *find* one.
- Four provider backends in a single tool, normalised to one
  `{title, url, snippet, published?, score?}` result schema:
  - **Tavily** — agent-tuned default. `TAVILY_API_KEY`.
  - **Exa** — neural / semantic search with `text` snippets.
    `EXA_API_KEY`.
  - **Brave** — independent keyword index. `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`.
  - **SerpAPI** — Google / Bing / etc. wrapper. `SERPAPI_API_KEY`.
- Provider resolution: explicit `provider` arg → `IRONCLAW_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER`
  env → auto-detect from configured keys in order
  `tavily, exa, brave, serpapi`. No keys configured surfaces a
  validation error naming all four env vars (errors over silent
  fallback).
- Host's `ContainerManager` now forwards
  `IRONCLAW_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER` + the four provider keys into the
  session container at spawn via a new `forward_env` field, so the
  operator only configures keys once in the host's `.env`.
- New skill: `skills/web-search/SKILL.md` (auto-loaded into the
  system prompt under the existing
  `IRONCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` mechanism).
- New doc: [`docs/web-search.md`](docs/web-search.md) — operator
  setup, provider trade-offs, egress allow-list interaction.

### Added (M14 — agent capability)

- `ProviderEvent::ToolCall` and a tool-use outer loop in the runner.
  The model now actually receives the schema for every in-tree tool
  and can call them per turn until it produces a turn without tool
  use (capped at 20 inner LLM rounds).
- Four computer-use tools wired through to the agent: `shell` (bash
  in container, 64 KiB output cap, 60 s default / 600 s ceiling),
  `read_file` (UTF-8 read, 1 MiB cap), `write_file` (create/append
  with auto-mkdir), `web_fetch` (HTTP GET/POST, 256 KiB body cap,
  30 s default / 120 s ceiling).
- Skill content auto-loaded into the agent's system prompt.
  `IRONCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` points at the SKILL.md library, optional
  `IRONCLAW_GROUPS_DIR` enables per-agent-group overrides under
  `<groups_dir>/<ag_uuid>/skills/`. Setup writes both env vars.
- New skills documenting the computer-use tools: `shell`,
  `read-file`, `write-file`, `web-fetch`.

### Added (M13 hardening — parallel-agent slice)

- **Image rebuild on `container_configs` change.** The manager
  fingerprints (`config_fingerprint` column) the rebuild-relevant
  fields and rebuilds + retags before the next spawn when they
  change. Rebuild failures log + emit
  `ironclaw_image_rebuild_failed_total` and fall back to the
  last-known-good image so the agent group is not blocked.
- **Container egress allow-list.** New
  `container_configs.egress_allow` (JSON array of host:port).
  Default empty == allow-all (default-allow + opt-in lockdown).
  Docker runtime translates to user-defined network policy; Apple
  Container runtime returns `RtError::Unsupported`. New
  `iclaw groups config set-egress-allow <id> --allow host:port ...`.
- **Per-group resource caps.** New
  `container_configs.resource_limits` JSON
  (`cpus` / `memory_mb` / `pids_limit`, all optional). Docker
  runtime applies via `--cpus` / `--memory` / `--pids-limit`. New
  `iclaw groups config set-resource-limits`.
- **Auto-applied `install_packages` / `add_mcp_server`.** The
  delivery loop now intercepts these system actions and writes
  directly to `container_configs.packages_apt` /
  `packages_npm` / `mcp_servers`. Combined with the rebuild
  fingerprint, the next spawn picks up the agent's tool calls
  automatically — no operator step required.
- **Central DB backup / restore.** `iclaw db backup <path>` runs
  a WAL checkpoint and atomically copies the file. `iclaw db
  restore <path>` always refuses with `host_running`; the
  operator-facing procedure is documented in
  `docs/db-backup.md` (stop host, copy file, restart).
- **Outbound dead-letter replay.** New
  `outbound_dropped_messages` table (migration `008_*`). Delivery
  failures that exhaust 3 retries land here.
  `iclaw dropped-messages outbound-list --since <window>` and
  `iclaw dropped-messages replay <id>` give the operator
  inspection / retry.
- **MCP server preset registry.** `iclaw mcp list-presets` shows
  the curated library (postgres, linear, github, notion,
  filesystem, browserbase). `iclaw mcp add <preset>
  --agent-group-id <id> --env K=V` writes the chosen preset into
  `container_configs.mcp_servers` (env values are redacted in the
  audit log).
- **Sender approval notifications in-channel.** When a new sender
  lands in `pending` for the first time, the host posts a plain-
  ASCII "approve?" notification to the agent group's primary
  messaging group. Dedup uses `unregistered_senders` so repeat
  senders don't re-spam.
- **Prometheus metrics endpoint.** Opt-in via
  `IRONCLAW_METRICS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9090` (bare port auto-prefixes
  to loopback). Counters:
  `ironclaw_messages_inbound_total{channel_type}`,
  `ironclaw_messages_outbound_total{channel_type}`,
  `ironclaw_containers_spawned_total`,
  `ironclaw_containers_crashed_total`,
  `ironclaw_delivery_failed_total{channel_type}`,
  `ironclaw_image_rebuild_failed_total`. Histograms:
  `ironclaw_llm_call_seconds`, `ironclaw_llm_tokens_input`,
  `ironclaw_llm_tokens_output`, `ironclaw_container_spawn_seconds`.
  New crate `ironclaw-metrics`.
- **Log rotation.** Opt-in via `IRONCLAW_LOG_DIR=<path>`. Adds a
  daily-rotating file writer (`host.log.<YYYY-MM-DD>`) alongside
  the existing stderr writer. `IRONCLAW_LOG` filter applies to
  both. Default stderr-only behaviour unchanged.
- **Audit-log env redaction.** The host's audit dispatch now masks
  values under any `env` block for `mcp.add` and
  `groups.config.set-mcp-servers` before serialising into
  `audit_log.args`. Keys are preserved; values become
  `<redacted>`.
- New docs: [`docs/container-config.md`](docs/container-config.md),
  [`docs/observability.md`](docs/observability.md),
  [`docs/db-backup.md`](docs/db-backup.md).

### Added

- One-command installer at `install.sh`: detects platform (Linux
  x86_64/aarch64, macOS arm64/x86_64), verifies Docker or Podman is
  reachable, then installs `ironclaw`, `iclaw`, and `ironclaw-setup`
  to `~/.local/bin` — preferring a prebuilt release tarball, falling
  back to `cargo install --git`, and finally `cargo install --path`
  when run inside a checkout. Re-running detects an existing install
  and offers upgrade/skip; setup state is resumed in place. Respects
  `NO_COLOR`, non-tty stdout, and quiets verbose output unless
  something fails.
- README "Install" section now leads with the one-liner; the
  longstanding `cargo build` instructions move under a "Manual install"
  subsection.
- One-terminal operator flow for the `ironclaw` binary: new
  `ironclaw start` (daemonize, write PID file, wait for admin socket
  ready), `ironclaw stop` (SIGTERM with SIGKILL escalation after a
  10s grace), `ironclaw status [--json]` (PID, uptime, paths, active
  session count; exits non-zero when not running for CI use), and
  `ironclaw logs [-f] [-n N]` (tail the host log). `ironclaw run`
  is preserved for foreground / service-managed deployments.
- `iclaw chat` now auto-starts the host via `ironclaw start` when
  the chat FIFO is missing; pass `--no-autostart` to keep the old
  "fail loudly" behaviour for scripted / CI use. Quick start
  collapses to `ironclaw start && iclaw chat` in one terminal.
- Interactive Telegram pairing wizard inside `ironclaw-setup`'s
  `channel` step. When the operator picks `telegram`, the wizard walks
  them through `@BotFather`, validates the token format
  (`^\d+:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`), verifies it via Telegram's `getMe`
  endpoint (10 s timeout, soft-fail on network errors), optionally
  polls `getUpdates` for ~60 s to capture the first chat id, and
  appends `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to the data-dir
  `.env`. Headless mode is driven by
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Tokens are never logged — the
  audit messages use `<digits>:****<last-4>` redaction.
- Initial Rust workspace with 16 crates across the host, runner,
  providers, MCP server, modules, skills, container runtime, OneCLI
  gateway, iclaw admin client, and interactive setup.
- Central DB schema (`ironclaw.db`) with idempotent migrations under
  `crates/ironclaw-db/migrations/`. Per-session inbound and outbound DBs
  with attachment-safety helpers (`safe_attachment_name`,
  `extract_to_inbox`, `read_from_outbox`).
- Host pipeline: router (hook chain, fan-out, session resolution),
  delivery (active 1s + sweep 60s, exponential backoff, 3-attempt cap),
  and sweep (stuck detection, recurrence fanout, processing-ack reset).
- Container runtime trait with Docker (bollard) and Apple Container
  (CLI shell-out) backends. Image build with apt/npm package
  contributions per `container_configs` and sha256-fingerprinted tags.
- Provider trait + Anthropic HTTP-streaming impl with tool-use loop and
  context compaction. Subprocess provider variants for Codex and
  OpenCode. Ollama provider via the Anthropic-compatible base URL.
- MCP server with the 15-tool inventory documented in PLAN.md section 7.
- Channel registry with 17 in-tree channels: cli, telegram, slack,
  discord, resend, github, linear, webex, matrix, teams, gchat,
  whatsapp-cloud, signal, deltachat, emacs, x, plus the in-progress
  imessage/wechat/whatsapp crates landing as follow-ups.
- Modules: typing, mount-security, permissions, approvals, interactive,
  scheduling, agent-to-agent, self-mod.
- Skill discovery (frontmatter parse + per-group override) and
  symlink-based container materialisation; 17 authored skills under
  `skills/`.
- `ironclaw-iclaw` Unix-socket admin server inside the host plus the
  `iclaw` client binary; 41 distinct commands exported as
  `ironclaw_iclaw::ALL_COMMANDS`.
- `ironclaw-setup` interactive setup with `dialoguer`, systemd /
  launchd unit generators, headless env-var-driven mode, and the
  `--migrate-from` data-directory migrator.
- `ironclaw-onecli` HTTP credential gateway with full wiremock coverage
  for 401/404/409/429/5xx and `Retry-After` parsing.
- M11 documentation: `docs/cutover.md` for predecessor migration,
  `docs/replay-fixtures.md` describing the differential-testing
  harness, and `docs/release-checklist.md` for cutting tagged
  releases.
- Baseline CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (rustfmt, clippy,
  test on Linux + macOS, coverage gate at 85%).
- `container-image` GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes
  the session base image to GHCR (`ghcr.io/<repo>/session`) for every
  push to `main` (as `:edge`) and tagged release (as `:<semver>` and
  `:latest`), with multi-arch (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) buildx output,
  GHA build cache, and an `ironclaw.fingerprint` provenance label.
- Checked-in `container/Dockerfile` for the session base image, carrying
  an `IRONCLAW_FINGERPRINT` build-arg stamped as an
  `ironclaw.fingerprint=<sha>` LABEL so pulled images can be verified
  against the locally-expected spec hash.
- `ironclaw-setup` `image` step now attempts a `docker pull` of the
  pre-built GHCR image before falling back to a local build. Pulls are
  verified by inspecting the image's `ironclaw.fingerprint` label;
  mismatches fall through to a local build with a clear "pulling
  failed, building locally" message. `IRONCLAW_SETUP_NO_PULL=1` skips
  the pull attempt for air-gapped or reproducible-build use cases;
  `IRONCLAW_SETUP_PULL_REGISTRY` overrides the registry slug for forks.

### Fixed

- Matrix `/sync` loop now respects cancellation while pushing inbound
  events, allowing the previously-ignored
  `sync_loop_pushes_events_and_persists_next_batch` test to run
  reliably without saturating the inbound mpsc.

### Known limitations

- Three M8 channels are noted in PLAN.md as the hardest of the set —
  imessage (macOS-local), wechat (Enterprise Work Weixin), and
  whatsapp (native Baileys port). Initial scaffolds are landing in
  follow-up commits; the whatsapp adapter ships behind a stubbed
  `CryptoBackend` until a real Signal-Protocol impl is wired in.
- Differential replay fixtures (M11) are designed in
  `docs/replay-fixtures.md` but the in-tree harness and captured
  fixtures are not yet committed.
